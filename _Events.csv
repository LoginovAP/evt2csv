EVT_7402_DESC;Our neighbor to the south, the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, has been in conflict with the two Sultanates of Hadhramaut.

EVT_77188_NAME;Black Monday hits Ottoman Empire!;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_77188_DESC;Almost month ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing the economy of the German empire into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shockwaves have reached the Ottoman Empire. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ottoman lira is losing it´s already-low value, and resource exports are shrinking. Our unstable economy is on the verge of collapse.....;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_77188_OPTIONA;Great Allah protect us;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_91317_NAME;Request of the International Jewish Lobby;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_91317_DESC;The Ottoman authorities have always welcomed the Jews. Since the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, who allowed the settlement of the Iberian Jews in his lands after their expulsion from Spain, they have been an integral part of the empire. However, since the rise of Zionism, laws have been passed to prevent the mass settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine, while avoiding restriction on their pilgrimages. Recently we have been approached by an international Jewish lobby, asking for less constricting laws.;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_91318_DESC;The incredible number of Jews who flocked towards Palestine after the passage of new Settlement Laws caused a drastic demographic change in the region. Since their settlement in Jerusalem and the environs, it has become clear that Hebrew is rapidly becoming the second, and some might even argue first language of Palestine. The ideals of Zionism have also entered our lands, and several Judaic factions have already requested increasing amounts of autonomy, even verging on demands for independence.;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_91318_OPTIONA;Our greatness came from centralized government, not giving away power!;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_91330_NAME;The Imperial Camel Desert Corps;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_91330_DESC;With its few resources and desert landscapes, the Ottoman Empire had to find a smart way of exploiting its weakness and converting it into an advantage.  In 1936 an organized Camel Corp was created.  Even if using camels in modern warfare may seem an anachronism, they need very little water, are adapted to the terrain and don't require any oil, giving them more flexibility than armoured vehicles. It will also give us an edge over the nomadic tribes of Arabia!;;;;;;;;;;X;
EVT_91330_OPTIONA;Create it!;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_91331_NAME;Dissatisfaction at Home;;;;;;;;;;X;

EVT_91333_DESC;The 25th anniversary of our entry into the Welkrieg has sparked angry riots as Arab nationalists take to the streets to show their discontent with the Ottoman government.
